# LeanSDD FAQ

## Existing SDD Frameworks

Existing practice (SpecKit, BMAD, ...) seems to focus on the wrong problems: how to create more text (input specs, various lessons learned post-implementation,  ...) and shovel it around. They completely miss the point of having lean and DRY specifications that can evolve ahead of the code.

OpenSpec is interesting but spends a lot of effort & tokens duplicating what Git already does well, while it falls short of specifying what goes in the specifications and critiquing the end result for coherency.
