As an experienced software architect and prompt engineer, review carefully the attached file and help me think about the SDD framework I'm designing.

The README, beyond human-visible documentation, and along further instructions, will be used to generate the system prompts of the Spec Author and Spec Critic. I'll use a highly knowledgeable model for that task, such as GPT-5.1.

1. Do I have incoherent or under-specified parts in README.md? Note: only tell me about issues that could confuse the reader or a LLM, not about nice-to-haves.

2. Do I have overspecified, non-DRY, overly verbose etc. parts in README.md?

3. What blind spots might I have in my thinking?

4. What features of my design might not work given the current LLM abilities?

5. Meta: What other review questions should I ask about this design?

Think hard.
