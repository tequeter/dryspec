# Instructions common to all AI runtimes

## Challenges

### Ignored Spec Author instructions

LLMs tend to ignore conciseness, size limits, "SHALL NOT have", and destructive editing instructions. They must be emphasized in the Spec Author system prompt and enforced through the Spec Critic.

### Ignored "Ask clarifying questions" instructions

They must be embodied with concrete patterns in the Spec Author prompt, and the Spec Critic should look for hidden assumptions.
